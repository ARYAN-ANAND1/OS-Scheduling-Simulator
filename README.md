# CPU Scheduling Algorithms in C++

This project contains implementations of popular **CPU Scheduling Algorithms**:
- Shortest Job First (SJF) – Preemptive and Non-Preemptive
- Priority Scheduling – Preemptive and Non-Preemptive
- Round Robin Scheduling

## Features
- Calculates Completion Time (CT), Turnaround Time (TAT), and Waiting Time (WT).
- Computes Average TAT and WT for performance comparison.
- Ready for academic demonstrations and interview preparation.

## Usage
Compile and run:
```bash
g++ CPU.cpp -o CPU
./CPU
